# Problem statement :page_facing_up:
To analyse the rainfall data in India in order to help the growth of agriculture by predicting the heavy rainfall to prevent flooding and damage in crops.
# Novelty :sparkles:
Rainfall prediction is important as heavy rainfall can lead to many disasters. The prediction helps people to take preventive measures and moreover the prediction should be accurate. So, it is important to analyse rainfall in order to prevent damage in crops.
# Social Impact :ear_of_rice:
India is an agricultural country and secondary agro based market will be steady with a good monsoon. Thus, the prediction of amount of rainfall can play a major role in agricultural field.
